# Learning_C
Hello, friends! Welcome to watch over my codes. I am glad to hear about you if you have willing to spend some time communicating with me.
If you would like to help me correct my codes, I am honor of that.
These Codes are created when l learn about C/C++ language, they have great possibility to have some problems to solve.
I hope that I can fix them when I am more familiar with C++.
